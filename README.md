A public shaming list of websites not having a "delete my account" option

Don't you like having to send an email to customer support to have your account deleted? I don't! Most websites have a profile editing page, so adding a link or button giving the users the possibility to delete their account, hence, their data from the database or services they don't use anymore is not complicated. For lack of better term, most of the time, I firmly believe this is a dark pattern. Why make it easier for people to delete their account? After all, we live in a world where KPI are everything...

This list should be a way for us, users, to publicly shame the websites who aren't giving that option, with the end goal of getting enough community pressure to "force" them to add this option, and make it default in every websites where we need to create an account.

Please, submit a PR (add them in alphabetical order) as you come accross new websites... Maybe a website will come out of this!
